# TicketSwap assessment
Thank you for doing our ui frontend assessment. The goal of the assessment is a page with notifications that can be added with a button. If you have any questions you can always [contact us](mailto:rob@ticketswap.com).

## Design
The design is included in the repo at `./design`. Included is a Sketch file and some preview images.

## Notifications data
We provided an array with data for the notifications at `./design/notifications.js` for your convenience. You can copy paste this in your own project.

## Handing in the assessment
When you're finished you can send it to us in reply of the mail you got with this assessment.

### Good luck
And again if you have any questions, [let us know](mailto:rob@ticketswap.com)!
